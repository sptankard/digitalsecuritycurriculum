<div class="SECA_H1" markdown="1"># SOCIAL MEDIA: BEING SMART, STAYING SAFE!</div>

Social media has been a powerful tool for all of our movements. Through social media we have been able to challenge the media blackout on many of our issues as well as rapidly mobilize collaborators across borders and issues. However, social media is not a neutral tool, social networks like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram may operate like civic public spaces, but in fact these are private self-surveilling corporate platforms with various degrees of collaboration with government surveillance systems.

As a result, many of us are vulnerable because we are unaware how our posts, tweets, and pictures are being used to create an enormous data portfolio for these corporations to use, sell, and share with other corporations and governments. This is why these platforms are not really free, because we pay for them with our data.

The question of visibility is something we all have to make our own risk assessments by doing a thorough analysis of the areas of your life that may contain risks if exposed. Many of us began by creating personal accounts on social media, later realizing the political, professional, and personal implications such visibility could have on our lives. A few common sense safeguards will go a long way in avoiding unwanted leaks of personal information or embarrassing reveals that can affect you and the worlds that you may be a part of.

All actions online must be well considered. Filling out a “Profile” or “About me” may seem relatively harmless, it is in fact a moment where you have to decide what information you want to make available, and how that relates to, or affects the work you do. Say for instance, you reveal the city you live in, the broad unknown online public will have information they can use to figure out your physical location. If security settings on your account are not set tightly, you may have made yourself vulnerable. We recommend you make decisions with careful consideration based on what you feel most comfortable with.

Questions to ask yourself:

* Who can access the information I am putting online?
* Who controls and owns the information I put into a social networking site?
* What information about me are my contacts passing on to other people?
* Will my contacts mind if I share information about them with other people?
* Do I trust everyone with whom I am connected?

COMPARTMENTALIZATION: PERSONAL VS PROFESSIONAL ACCOUNTS

A piece of sound advice is to maintain two accounts if you feel vulnerable. It's perfectly acceptable to develop separate accounts for personal and professional uses. Many folks open two accounts within the same social media site, one for each purpose. However, be aware that your colleagues could be connected to you via a professional account only but there is still a chance they could find and view your personal account.

Many activists today already maintain a professional and personal Facebook account. This helps the individual to express harder political points of view on Facebook, Instagram, and other platforms without worrying about how their views will affect their job searches and employment. So the first part of this section will speak to this compartmentalization.

PROFESSIONAL

* Links and Resources
* Positions on Academic/Industry Focus
* No Explicit political position

PERSONAL

* More political
* More personal
* Understanding these are thoughts in process

<div class="GLBL_H2" markdown="1">## FACEBOOK</div>

Here are some ways we can assign settings that make our experiences on Facebook as private and safe as possible.

<div class="col-xs-12 none">
			<div class="well none" style="border-radius:0; background=transparent; border=0px;">
                           <span class="check-icon"><i class="fa fa-check" ></i></span> <span class="check-highlight"></span><span class="check-text" markdown="1">GENERAL SETTINGS AND TOOLS </span>

This will take you to the Settings menu. On the left-hand side, you can choose different categories of settings. The first tab is General Account Settings, where you can edit information about your name, username, email, password, networks, and language.

You should update your password regularly, preferably at least once every three months. Remember, it is extremely important that you choose a strong password to protect your account and your information.

It's also worth noting, though, that everything you post is recorded by Facebook (including when you select Only Me) and can be handed over by them to third parties.</span>

WHO CAN CONTACT ME?

In this section, you can decide who is able to send you a friend request. This is not particularly important in terms of information security, since in the end, it is still you who decides who to accept as a friend, and you should always exercise caution and avoid adding people who are unknown or untrusted. If you want to change this setting, click Edit.

Whose messages do I want filtered into my inbox?: Facebook allows you to filter the messages you receive into two folders: Inbox and Other. Here you can choose between Basic Filtering, which is more permissive of messages from people who are not on your friend list, and Strict Filtering, which is less permissive.

WHO CAN LOOK ME UP?

Here, you can limit the ease with which people can look you up by knowing your phone number or e-mail address (although this is still technically possible), as well as limiting people's ability to find your Facebook page via search engines. FB's default settings make it as easy for individuals to find you this way, including possible adversaries.

		     </div>

TIMELINE AND TAGGING

As we have mentioned before, your information security on Facebook has a lot to do with the behavior of your friends. In the Timeline and Tagging menu, you can determine what happens when friends tag you or your posts and what happens when they post on your timeline.

<div class="col-xs-12 none">
			<div class="well none" style="border-radius:0; background=transparent; border=0px;">
                           <span class="check-icon"><i class="fa fa-check" ></i></span> <span class="check-highlight"></span><span class="check-text" markdown="1">In the left-hand sidebar, click on the Timeline and Tagging menu.</span>
		       </div>
		     </div>


![](/images/Curriculum_img_181.jpg)




If you want your timeline to be truly yours, it's advisable to disallow posts on your timeline from anyone but yourself. To do this, click edit beside Who can post on your timeline and select Only Me.

Here, you can decide what happens when other friends tag you in their posts and photographs.

<div class="col-xs-12 none">
			<div class="well none" style="border-radius:0; background=transparent; border=0px;">
                           <span class="check-icon"><i class="fa fa-check" ></i></span> <span class="check-highlight"></span><span class="check-text" markdown="1">It is advisable that you click edit and enable the Review posts that friends tag you in option so that you can prevent any irresponsible tagging appearing on your timeline. However, this will not prevent their posts (including your tag) from being visible to their friends, or perhaps even the public, depending on their settings.</span>
		       </div>
		     </div>

Who can see things on my timeline? This item is associated with the previous options. Previously, we've decided who gets to publish material to your timeline, and here, you get to decide who can read them.

<div class="col-xs-12 none">
			<div class="well none" style="border-radius:0; background=transparent; border=0px;">
                           <span class="check-icon"><i class="fa fa-check" ></i></span> <span class="check-highlight"></span><span class="check-text" markdown="1">If you click Edit, you can change these settings so that either everyone, friends of friends, a custom group of people, or only yourself can see posts you've been tagged in, or things others post on your timeline.</span>
		       </div>
		     </div>

The first option, View As, is an interesting way to see what certain individuals can see on your timeline.

<div class="col-xs-12 none">

These are important side notes that are meant to stress to avoid actions that could make you vulnerable or include actions that could keep you safer.</span>
		        </div>
		     </div>

How can I manage tags people add and tagging suggestions? This refers to tags of you by other users of Facebook. It's best if you switch on the Review tags people add to your own posts before the tags appear on Facebook option, and limit the audience for the second option to Only Me. Facebook has begun using a form of facial recognition technology which allows it to identify

photographs that look like you among your friends and contacts photos. Facebook will even notify them to tag you. Naturally, for rights advocates, this could be particularly sensitive.

FOLLOWERS

Facebook gives you the option of allowing people to subscribe to your news feed, without being friends. Be aware however, that if you allow others to subscribe to your news feed, then some of your data is available for them and others in their network to see. The safest option is not to allow people to subscribe to your news feed.

FOLLOWER SETTINGS

Applications

Many Facebook users love and actively add third party applications in order to play games, enhance communications, and more. But keep in mind each application is associated with your Facebook account, and the basic data of your Facebook account will be available to any application (such as your name, gender, public pictures and network). Also, when installing a new application, it may ask for your permission to have access to information about you and your friends. This includes a variety of data, such as age, place of residence, education, circle of friends and contacts. Thus, the application can gather and share information such as what country you come from and where you currently are, information you may consider sensitive. Therefore, for safety reasons, we recommend not to use Facebook applications unless you really need to.

<div class="col-xs-12 none">
			<div class="well none" style="border-radius:0; background=transparent; border=0px;">
                           <span class="check-icon"><i class="fa fa-check" ></i></span> <span class="check-highlight"></span><span class="check-text" markdown="1">Click on Apps in the menu on the left.</span>
		       </div>
		     </div>


![](/images/Curriculum_img_191.jpg)




APPS YOU USE

Here, you can enable or disable the so-called “Facebook Platform” which allows you to quickly register and sign in on other sites using your Facebook account. This option is enabled by default. On the one hand, it's convenient: no need to spend time on registration forms, filling in fields. On the other hand, comments on news storys, or signed petitions can link to your Facebook account, where it's recorded and possibly shared.

<div class="col-xs-12 none">

APPS OTHERS USE

We also have to consider that some of our Facebook friends bring our information into the apps that they use.

ADVERTISING SETTINGS

Advertising is fundamentally important to social networking companies because it's how they make their money. There will always be advertisements on social networking sites such as Facebook, though we can make them less personal, which is the right move in terms of information security and privacy.

<div class="col-xs-12 none">
			<div class="well none" style="border-radius:0; background=transparent; border=0px;">
                           <span class="check-icon"><i class="fa fa-check" ></i></span> <span class="check-highlight"></span><span class="check-text" markdown="1">In the column on the left, select Ads.</span>
		       </div>
		     </div>

Facebook currently promises not to associate your name or picture with third-party advertisements, although they leave space for this to be possible in the future. It's a good idea to change these settings so that your details still remain private in case advertising rules change in the future.

<div class="col-xs-12 none">
			<div class="well none" style="border-radius:0; background=transparent; border=0px;">
                           <span class="check-icon"><i class="fa fa-check" ></i></span> <span class="check-highlight"></span><span class="check-text" markdown="1">Click Edit beside Third Party Sites. Select No-one and select Save Changes.</span>
		       </div>
		     </div>

SOCIAL ADS

Here, Facebook encourages users to become ambassadors for products or pages they have 'liked'. This means that you could be used to advertise a page or product to your friends. If this makes you uncomfortable, it's recommended that you disable it.

<div class="col-xs-12 none">
			<div class="well none" style="border-radius:0; background=transparent; border=0px;">
                           <span class="check-icon"><i class="fa fa-check" ></i></span> <span class="check-highlight"></span><span class="check-text" markdown="1">Under Ads and friends, click Edit and select No-One from the drop-down menu.</span>
		       </div>
		     </div>


![](/images/Curriculum_img_197.jpg)




By default Facebook tries to display targeted advertising on your tastes and interests.

<div class="col-xs-12 none">
			<div class="well none" style="border-radius:0; background=transparent; border=0px;">
                           <span class="check-icon"><i class="fa fa-check" ></i></span> <span class="check-highlight"></span><span class="check-text" markdown="1">To get rid of this, you need to click on the Opt Out link in this paragraph.</span>
		       </div>
		     </div>

This will open a page titled Custom Audiences from your Website and Mobile App, where Facebook gives more information about its advertising policy.

<div class="col-xs-12 none">

                           <span class="check-icon"><i class="fa fa-check" ></i></span> <span class="check-highlight"></span><span class="check-text" markdown="1">In the middle of the text is the Opt Out button for you to confirm.</span>

<div class="GLBL_H2" markdown="1">## TWITTER</div>

Twitter<sup>1</sup> has become a valuable platform where activists around the world break their stories and ideas. It's become a place for, real on the ground news updates on movements and protest, where the oppressed have a voice and are able to connect with people in a real and powerful way.

Twitter states in its terms of service: “This license is you authorizing us to make your Tweets available to the rest of the world and to let others do the same. But what’s yours is yours—you own your content.” While this may be the case, Twitter reserves the right to hand over your information to governments should a request be made.

Keep in mind, Twitter is actively monitored by numerous governments, including the United States. Moreover, Twitter's Terms of Service state that they will share your information in response to legal requests including governmental investigations. For more information, see Twitter's Privacy Policy and its Transparency Report.

Although it's a website, many people interact with and manage Twitter via desktop and smartphone applications that are known as Twitter clients. If you use a client you should make sure it is connecting to the site securely, over an encrypted connection.

Like Facebook, many people use Twitter in conjunction with numerous other websites and applications in order to share status updates, photos, locations, links, and so forth. Using these applications pose many potential additional security vulnerabilities, and it is very important that the privacy settings on all other applications are made as secure as possible.

Read on to understand how better to secure your Twitter!

BASIC ACCOUNT SETTINGS ON <div class="GLBL_H2" markdown="1">## TWITTER</div>

Twitter's Basic Account Settings allow you to control how people can find your profile, what information you share and the level of security your account requires when you are using the web-browser based version of Twitter (that is to say, not a client, smartphone app, or GSM phone).

Twitter also gives you the option of adding a location to your tweets under the Tweet Location option. This option is disabled by default. If sharing your location widely is appropriate in order to stay safe, then this option may be useful. However, it is generally recommended that you leave this feature disabled as your location information can also be very useful to your adversaries.

Discoverability gives you the option of allowing people to find your Twitter account if they already have your e-mail address. If you wish to maintain more privacy for your Twitter account, it's recommended that you disable this option.

In the Personalization and Promotion section, Twitter gives you the option of allowing them to monitor your behavior on their site and other websites. This allows them to tailor the content and ads they show you, which are selected based on you interests. It also helps them know which third parties might be interested in buying information related to your consumer behaviors and hobbies. It is recommended that you uncheck these boxes for more privacy.

MOBILE SETTINGS ON <div class="GLBL_H2" markdown="1">## TWITTER</div>

You can open Twitter's mobile settings by clicking on Mobile in the menu on the left-hand side. Here, Twitter encourages you to download the smartphone app and also gives you the option of activating Twitter text messaging, which allows you to tweet directly from your mobile phone. As noted above, it is not advisable to associate your Twitter account to your mobile phone if you wish to maintain a degree of privacy or anonymity while tweeting. Also, remember that text messages sent over the GSM network are not encrypted and are easily interceptable and traceable to their authors.

GENERAL GUIDELINES ON CLIENTS AND APPS

Twitter users can allow various third-party applications, including other social networking and photo-sharing sites to interact with their Twitter accounts, for example in order to share photos uploaded via websites such as Instagram, or TwitPic.<sup>2</sup> However, data when using social networking sites you must be careful when integrating your profiles on different social networking

sites. These third-party sites have their own terms of use, privacy policies and privacy settings which are not necessarily the same as Twitter's. Even if your Twitter account is relatively secure, your profiles on a third-party app/website may be completely exposed. Using the same username for multiple sites and accounts can make it easier for you to be tracked, using different names decreases that risk. The number of third-party sites and apps are vast, and only a few are explored in this guide. However, it is vital that you research and update your security settings on all third-party apps linked to your Twitter page. If you do not consider them secure enough, delete your profile and revoke its access to your Twitter account.

Things to keep in mind about private posts:

* Private posts you share to social networks may be visible to the public depending on your privacy settings for those networks. For example, a post you share to Twitter that was set to private on Instagram may be visible to the people who can see your Twitter posts.

* Once you make your posts private, people will have to send you a follow request if they want to see your posts, your followers list or your following list. Follow requests then appear in Activity, where you can approve or ignore them.

* If someone was already following before you set your posts to private and you do not want them to see your posts, you can block them.

* People can send a photo or video directly to you even if they’re not following you.
