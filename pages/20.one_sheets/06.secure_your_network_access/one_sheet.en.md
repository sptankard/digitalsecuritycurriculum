Securing your network access is crucial to being able to access the internet safely as your Internet Service provider (ISP) is often where much surveillance happens. If you do not secure your network access you are not only revealing your location and the content of your internet browsing, but the ISP can also filter, surveil, and even block sites from you at their own servers. Secure Network Access softwares take these scenarios into consideration and offers ways to protect your network access. Think of it as a condom to shields and anonymize your computer as it accesses the internet.
