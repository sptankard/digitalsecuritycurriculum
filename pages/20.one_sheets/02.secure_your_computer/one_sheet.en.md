<span class="leadtip" style="color:#5157b1">✔ USE A STRONG ANTI-MALWARE SOFTWARE ROUTINELY</span> meaning once a week. We recommend MalwareBytes and check for updates frequently. You can find it here [https://www.malwarebytes.com/](https://www.malwarebytes.com/)

<span class="leadtip" style="color:#5157b1">✔ DON’T OPEN ATTACHMENTS</span>! This is the main way people get hacked. Don’t believe us, ask the Democratic National Party!  If someone sends you a file on any platform and it is a file that can be opened by Google apps then do it. This includes Word, Excel, PDF, and even some image files. This is because Google can handle malware that might be lurking in such files while your own computer cannot. If it is something you don't feel comfortable uploading to Google then download the file and scan it with your own anti-malware software. But make sure your anti-malware software is updated. Finally, you can also upload the file to virustotal.com and scan it against many anti-virus libraries as an alternative process.
