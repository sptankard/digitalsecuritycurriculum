The Harm Reduction Approach
---------------------------

**Harm reduction** is a term used in public health to describe
policies aimed at reducing the harm associated with high-risk
behaviors, such as intravenous drug use. In the context of digital
security training, the harm reduction approach can be applied to
people that are at heightened risk of compromise because of their
practices, such as using non-optimal hardware, applications, or
platforms. It is not always possible to change somebody's (or our own)
risky practices and when that is the case, it is important to meet
people where they are, rather than where we think they should be.

Some principles to follow are:

- Everyone deserves digital security and privacy.
- Remove the stigma of bad security or privacy practices.
- Increasing your digital safety is a process.
- Harm reduction is collective.

Everyone deserves digital security and privacy.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is not uncommon to hear people in the security industry say that if
you don’t use a certain product or you don’t follow a certain best
practice, then “you don’t deserve security.” This is a highly toxic
mentality that causes a lot of harm. A techie may believe that
activists should not use Facebook, but if activists still use the
platform because it is a highly effective way of reaching their
audience, then they need and deserve advice that allows them to be as
safe on Facebook as possible.

Remove the stigma of bad security or privacy practices.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Everyone has made digital privacy or security mistakes, including
trainers and "experts". Stigmatizing or shaming people for confessing
their mistakes makes it less likely that other people will speak up
about their own practices. Talking about our own digital security
shortcomings is sometimes a good ice-breaker and helps make everyone
feel more comfortable.

Increasing your digital safety is a process.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When learning about what we need to do to improve our digital security
and privacy, it’s common to feel overwhelmed. Don't be too hard on
yourself -- instead, we can see our work towards better security
habits as a process that will take time. The goal isn't to lock
everything down in one day or one week. It takes time and patience to
learn, and it’s important to give ourselves credit for how we have
*already* improved our digital safety, even as we take further steps
and solidify better habits.

Harm reduction is collective.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Because of the many ways our digital lives are inherently intertwined,
it’s important to remember that we are responsible for each others’
safety and privacy. It’s upon us to collectively support each other as
we learn about each other’s privacy preferences.

We can coordinate in
reducing threats and vulnerabilities that affect us as co-workers,
family members, activists, or even just neighbors using the same cafe
WiFi to browse the web. When you notice that others have unsafe
settings or are leaking personal data, you can tell them. If you
prefer not to be tagged in photos on social media, let others know and
ask others what their preferences are. If you see your parents have a
weak password, take the time to explain how to create a more robust
one.

There’s a million ways we can help our networks reduce the harm
from poor digital security habits and build better security cultures.

While many people often use military or war analogies
when talking about digital security,
thinking about it that way can often be misleading.
In many ways, analogies to public health and medicine
can be much more informative and helpful.

Why We Should Care -- And Act
-----------------------------

It's important to understand not just the what and the how of digital
security, but the *why*. Why should we care about digital security?
And, why should we take action to develop our personal security?

General tips and tricks about technology are great, but we also need
to understand ourselves. There are several types of common thought
patterns that can keep us from learning:

:Nothing-to-Hide Apathy:
   “I have nothing to hide, so why do I need to protect privacy?”
:Security Paralysis:
   “I am worried about my digital security to the point of being overwhelmed.
   I don't know where to start.”
:Technical Confusion:
   “I’m ready to take action, but not until I have a perfect handle on how
   all of these technical concepts fit together.”
:Security Nihilism:
   “There’s no such thing as perfect security, so why even bother?
   If someone wants to hack me, they’ll figure out a way to do it.”

----

- What made you come today?

----

Genuineness and empathy is important. No one is perfect.

Many security trainers like to make their stories sound scary or
intimidating. But these types of stories often turn people off from
learning about security. Fear is the motivation killer, and can lead
to “security paralysis” or other kinds of disengagement from learning.

Also, a single person can cycle through several of the attitudes below
(and more!). The better we are at spotting and responding to our
motivational hangups, the better we can learn.

Nothing-to-Hide Apathy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*“I have nothing to hide, so why do I need to protect privacy?”*

People with this attitude typically do not feel a personal stake in
their digital privacy and security, and therefore do not feel
compelled to act. They may associate digital security concepts with
high-profile state actors, whistleblowers, and public figures -- not
with “normal” people like us.

Talking through the first step of threat modeling -- the question
“What do you want to protect?” can also be helpful towards finding
your own stake in digital security.

Some examples:

- Credit card and bank account information (both on the associated
  websites and on any commerce websites like Amazon, PayPal, or
  Venmo).
- The information often found on “people finder” sites -- like full
  names, home addresses, and family connections.

It’s also common for the “nothing to hide argument” to become so
dominant that we forget what’s at play when we talk about privacy.
What is privacy and what does it mean to people? What are we really
talking about when we talk about privacy? This is a complex topic, but
as one researcher puts it:

  Privacy is Consent. Privacy is the right to consent.
  Privacy is the right to withdraw consent.
  Privacy is nothing more than that, but that is everything.

Finally, sometimes someone with this attitude is making a logical
decision based on their own threat model. Having identified what they
want to protect, who may come after it, and what their risk is, they
may have simply decided that a certain privacy protection is not worth
them expending significant time, resources, or energy. The job of a
trainer is not to “convince” them that they “should” take certain
actions, but to help them make an informed decision.

Security Paralysis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*“I am worried about my digital security to the point of being
overwhelmed. I don’t know where to start.”*

This kind of person cares deeply about digital security, but is
frightened and paralyzed. Often, people with this attitude are
overwhelmed with the task of locking down their personal information.
Perhaps they have been bombarded with news stories about leaks and
data breaches, or have close friends who have experienced personal
harassment or doxxing. They may have even been exposed to
intimidation-based trainings in the past that left them feeling
overwhelmed and helpless in the face of various digital threats.

In this case, it can be helpful to emphasize one’s personal agency.
At the same time,
acknowledge the reality that it may very well be impossible
to control all the information about one person online -- and
*that’s okay*.
Instead, we can shift the goal
from erasing all our information
to just minimizing our information.

First steps to take could include
Googling oneself (perhaps with the support of a trusted
friend to help alleviate any fear associated with doing so),
investigating social media settings, or
looking into opt-out options on people finder sites.

The goal is to get the best idea possible
of the information available about ourselves online,
and then reduce it according to what we care about and are worried about.
If we can minimize the information that we have control over,
then we are in a much more powerful position if and when
a company we use has a data breach or
a social media platform we’re on changes its default settings.

Technical Confusion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*“I’m ready to take action, but not until I have a perfect handle on
how all of these technical concepts fit together.”*

This kind of person may be technically overwhelmed. They are hearing
about different kinds of devices, operating systems, apps, software,
browser extensions, and encryption. While they have abundant
information, they have no idea where to start or exactly how all these
things are connected. Often, these learners have less experience with
technology than the average trainer, but they are detail-oriented and
cautious. They may be elders, or come from a low-resource
background that has not given them consistent access to cutting-edge
devices and software. Just like security paralysis, this person
typically does not know where to start.

If this is your case,
it can help to focus on the security principles behind the technology.
Technology changes quickly and can be confusing,
but fundamental security principles --
threat modeling/risk assessment, tradeoffs, and deciding who and what to trust --
can all act as steadfast guides as technology changes and evolves.

Security is more than just tools. It’s about adopting a “security
mindset” over time.

Security Nihilism
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*“There’s no such thing as perfect security, so why even bother? If
someone wants to hack me, they’ll figure out a way to do it.”*

People with this attitude care about security, but also don’t know
what to actually do. Or, perhaps more accurately, they do not think
they have the power to do much.

One useful concept is “**door lock security**.” Think about the lock
on the door of your home. It might be a normal deadbolt with a
doorknob lock. This lock can be compromised in any number of ways:
keys can be stolen or forged, locks can be picked, doors can be kicked
down. If someone was determined to breach that door, they probably
could. But you probably still locks your door regularly and finds some
assurance in that level of security.

This analogy can even extend to extra layers of security. Perhaps you
can imagine someone with particularly expensive items in their home
having a security system protecting the perimeter of their house. Or,
maybe they’d have a safe inside the house for valuables and important
documents.

We can approach digital security in the same way. The digital security
equivalent of a “door lock” can be reliable, reasonable, and worth
using, even if it is imperfect and incomplete. For higher-value
assets, added layers of security (analogous to safes or home security
systems) can also be put in place.

The goal is to make it *harder* or *more inconvenient* or *more
expensive* to hack you, not to make it impossible. It's important to
set reasonable, achievable goals, not pie-in-the-sky theoretical
scenarios.

Seven Keys To Digital Security
------------------------------

Here are some basic tips to consider when thinking about your own
digital security.

1. Knowledge is Power
2. The Weakest Link
3. Simpler is Safer and Easier
4. More Expensive Doesn't Mean More Secure
5. It's Okay To Trust *Someone* (But Always Know Who You're Trusting)
6. There is No Perfect Security -- There’s Always a Trade-Off
7. What's Secure Today May Not Be Secure Tomorrow


Knowledge is Power
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Good security decisions can't be made without good information. Your
security tradeoffs are only as good as the information you have about
the value of your assets, the severity of the threats from different
adversaries to those assets, and the risk of those attacks actually
happening. This guide should help you gain the knowledge you need to
identify the threats to your computer and communications security, and
judge the risk against possible security measures. And some of this
knowledge you already have: knowledge of your own situation, who might
want to target you, and what resources they have. You already have
more power than you think!

The Weakest Link
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Think about assets as components of the system in which they are used.
The security of the asset depends on the strength of all the
components in the system. The old adage that "a chain is only as
strong as its weakest link" applies to security too: The system as a
whole is only as strong as the weakest component. For example, the
best door lock is of no use if you have weak window latches.
Encrypting your email so it won't get intercepted in transit won't
protect the confidentiality of that email if you store an unencrypted
copy on your laptop and your laptop is stolen. That doesn't mean you
have to do everything simultaneously, but it does mean that, over
time, you should spend time thinking about each part of your
information and computer use.

Simpler is Safer and Easier
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is generally most cost-effective and most important to protect the
weakest component of the system in which an asset is used. Since
having a simple system makes it much easier to identify and understand
the weak components, you should strive to reduce the number and
complexity of components in your information systems. A small number
of components will also serve to reduce the number of interactions
between components, which is another source of complexity, cost, and
risk. That also means that the safest solution may be the least
technical solution. Computers may be great for many things, but
sometimes the security issues of a simple pen and notepaper can be
easier to understand, and therefore easier to manage.

More Expensive Doesn't Mean More Secure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Don't assume that the most expensive security solution is the best;
especially if it takes away resources needed elsewhere. Low-cost
measures like shredding trash before leaving it on the curb can give
you lots of bang for your security buck.

It's Okay To Trust *Someone* (But Always Know Who You're Trusting)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Computer security advice can end up sounding like you should trust
absolutely no one but yourself. In the real world, you almost
certainly trust plenty of people with at least *some* of your
information, from your close family or companion to your doctor or
lawyer.
What's tricky in the digital space is understanding who you
are trusting, and with what. You might deposit a list of passwords
with your lawyers: but you should think about what power that might
give them -- or how easily they might be maliciously attacked. You might
write documents in a cloud service like Dropbox or Microsoft OneDrive
that are only for you: but you're also letting Dropbox and Microsoft
access them, too. Online or offline, the fewer people you share a
secret with, the better chance you have of keeping it secret.

There is No Perfect Security -- There’s Always a Trade-Off
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Set security policies that are reasonable for your lifestyle, for the
risks you face, and for the implementation steps you and your
colleagues will take. A perfect security policy on paper won't work if
it's too difficult to follow day-to-day.

What's Secure Today May Not Be Secure Tomorrow
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is also crucially important to continually re-evaluate your
security practices. Just because they were secure last year or last
week doesn't mean they're still secure!
Keep checking sites like
`SSD (EFF's Surveillance Self-Defense guide) <https://ssd.eff.org/>`_
because they will update their advice to reflect changes in their
understanding and the realities of digital security. Security is never
a one-off act: it's a process.

Some actual tech advice: The Minimum Viable Teaching
----------------------------------------------------

(When Teachers Have No Time To Teach or Learners Have No Time to Listen)

Sometimes there’s no time for a full digital security walk-through.
Perhaps you're suddenly about to face an unexpected set of risks. Too
much information can be overwhelming or intimidating. You're short on
time. You might have only one brief moment for security, and you want
to take full advantage of it.

Some security is always better than no security. You can do a lot to
improve your basic security by walking through some basic steps, and
following some general advice.

Here's a short bit of advice that can fit in one minute or less. It’s
a concentrated form of advice. This information could easily expand it
into a half-day of teaching, but the short version is good too.

   “You can turn on encryption on your Android, iPhone, iPad or Mac. Pick a
   long password made up of six or more random words to lock your computer,
   or six or more numbers as a PIN to lock your phone. Don’t reuse
   passwords! Use a password manager, or write down your passwords on paper
   and store it in your wallet instead. Turn on “two-factor” or “two-step”
   authentication on your Google, Facebook or other online accounts: this
   will help stop those logins from being hacked. Avoid clicking on strange
   links or email attachments. To send messages safely and securely, use an
   end-to-end encrypted messenger app like Signal or WhatsApp. If you want
   to be anonymous online, try using the Tor Browser.”

Well, that was the concentrated version.
Now let's break it down and talk about it.

The basics:

-  Turn on encryption.
-  Pick a long password.
-  Don’t reuse your passwords!
-  Turn on two-factor authentication.
-  Avoid clicking on strange links or email attachments.
-  Use an end-to-end encrypted messenger app like Signal or WhatsApp.
-  To be anonymous online, use the Tor Browser.

Here’s some more detailed thinking about each of those pieces of
advice, and how you might dig deeper into them, when you have more
time.

Turn on encryption.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We say “turn on encryption” because that phrase typed into a search
engine gives you good links to general instructions on encryption.
(Unfortunately we can’t say “turn on encryption” on Windows, because
only Windows Professional offers full disk encryption.)

Pick a long password.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

“Long” is more understandable than “strong.” PIN is understood as the
number that locks your phone, so you can extend this by including it
in the same sentence to include desktop PC or laptop device logins.
“Random” is a bit technical, but gets across the idea that it
shouldn’t just be a familiar sentence. We spend a lot of time arguing
internally about whether we should say “six” or “seven”!

Don’t reuse your passwords!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Reusing passwords is one of the top ways that accounts can be
compromised, but it can be hard to stop doing it. One thing that can
really help is to use a tool called a “password manager”. There are a
number of password manager guides, such as the ones on SSD.
Additionally, it might sound surprising, but you can actually write
down passwords and keep them in your wallet! This might seem insecure,
but it's actually much better than reusing passwords. (Password reuse
really is very bad.)

Why do passwords matter so much? Check out websites like
https://www.HaveIBeenPwned.com/ -- Password dumps affect regular
people all the time.

Turn on two-factor authentication.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In an attempt to “avoid jargon,” almost every web service uses a
different term for two-factor authentication. We say “two-factor or
two-step” to imply that it might be called a number of different
things. We also give the basic reason why you should turn on
two-factor authentication: it will help stop your logins and accounts
from being hacked.

Understanding *why* two-factor might protect you is difficult,
but getting the benefit from it is not.

For info on how to tell what accounts offer two-factor authentication,
you can use websites like
https://www.twofactorauth.org/.
(Generally, websites like Google, Facebook, etc support it.)

Avoid clicking on strange links or email attachments.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We say this to reinforce the idea that you are most vulnerable to
phishing when presented with links or attachments, but security
experts have long internal debates about this advice too. Can anyone
really go through life not clicking on any links or email attachments?
Can anyone confidently tell when a link or attachment is “strange”
(that is, a fraudulent attempt to trick you into accepting malware onto
your computere)?

In concrete terms, if you receive strange attachments or links, one
thing you can do is talk to the supposed sender in person or over the
phone, to verify the weird email. But if you have better suggestions,
go for it (and let us know!).

Use an end-to-end encrypted messenger app like Signal or WhatsApp.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Our first product mention! Break out the ™ symbols! JK. Recommending
specific software or hardware is actually very complicated, but people
usually want a concrete suggestion. So why Signal?

Signal was one of the first audited, open source, messaging devices
with a strong theoretical cryptographic foundation, backed by an
organization specifically dedicated to providing secure end-to-end
encryption. It suffers from some of the problems of a small and
underfunded software project, but it is reasonably safe from
compromise and has a broad user base.

WhatsApp’s parent company, Facebook, is not very trustworthy, but the
client itself is end-to-end encrypted, and (we believe) is unlikely to
be undermined without a large and highly critical expert audience
spotting the problem.

By offering two alternatives, we try to imply that the important thing
here is “secure messaging app” rather than a particular secure
messaging app. We put this advice at the end of our list, because at
this point no one will remember much beyond the brand names.

To be anonymous online, use the Tor Browser.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

People are often more curious about anonymity than fighting
surveillance (they are more concerned about being generally exposed
online, than specifically monitored by the authorities).

Staying anonymous online involves more than just using Tor, but the
Tor project does a good job of warning people who download their
software about this. We try to convey that Tor is a solution for
anonymity, and not one for defending against surveillance or other
side-effects.

“Use Tor; Use Signal” is not always the best advice, but if you start
searching for advice on Tor and Signal, there’s a good chance you will
be directed to more detailed guidance by experts who know what they’re
talking about.

A positive security culture for organizers
------------------------------------------

Following the uptick in alt-right activity after Charlottesville, a
group called Equality Labs wrote up a guide for organizers about
protecting yourself from doxxing attacks.

   *Equality Labs is
   a South Asian community technology organization, that
   works at the intersection of community-based participatory research,
   socially-engaged arts, and digital security. They are dedicated to
   ending caste apartheid, Islamophobia, and religious intolerance; and
   they place an emphasis on further elevating trans and cis femme voices
   from these communities.*

Here's what they put in the intro to their guide:

   Hey Movement Fam,
   
   It is the folks from Equality Labs and we have an urgent Anti-Doxing
   guide to support the activists who are getting slammed by Alt-right
   Forces around the country for coming out and resisting Nazis from
   Charlottesville to Berkeley.
   
   [...] Post Charlottesville, Boston, and the Bay Area Anti-White
   supremacist marches we are seeing an unprecedented number of doxing
   attacks on all members of the movements. [#eqlabsguide]_

"Security culture" is important for crisis times, but it's also
important for the long run. Additionally, it's important to ensure
that this is a positive and inclusive vision of security culture, not
a toxic one. Equality Labs, collaborating with and building on work by
groups like Stop LAPD Spying Coalition, have outlined such a vision.

The challenges we face (such as the escalated activity of the White
Supremacists after Charlottesville, or the regular grind of state
oppression) may be scary, but the best defense is one rooted in
information, compassion and self-care for ourselves and each other,
and a commitment to collective resilience.

What to do? What is security culture? The basic idea is to adopt best
practices to stay safe. These are things that should be incorporated
into your regular digital security practices, and into your regular
habits more generally. The practices will help lock you down through
attacks. But it's not enough to just do it once and then move on:
You need to maintain these things to keep your digital resilience.
*"Security is a process, not a product."*

Stop LAPD Spying Coalition talk about adopting a vision of *security
culture* that centers all collective security practices as a form of
expressing love and solidarity. We all have a sense of it from being
marginalized, targeted, and activists. It’s about harnessing those
good instincts with knowledge and practice.

We can build power instead of paranoia, and meet people where they’re
at. From there we can have communities of practice that normalize
better practices in a way that is resilient in a crisis.

Digital security is a system. You are creating and implementing it as
part of your core skills as an organizer. There is no silver bullet to
digital security -- it is an awareness and a practice. It gets better
with reiteration and with a community committed together to stay safe.
The best defense is a collective one and we are all in it together. :)
